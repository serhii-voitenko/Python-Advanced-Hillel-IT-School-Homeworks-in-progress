"""TASK-1
Write a function:
def solution(A)
that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.
Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

"""TASK-2
A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones
at both ends in the binary representation of N.
For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2.
The number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3.
The number 20 has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1.
The number 15 has binary representation 1111 and has no binary gaps.
The number 32 has binary representation 100000 and has no binary gaps.

Write a function:

def solution(N)

that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap.
The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.

For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation 10000010001 and so its 
longest binary gap is of length 5. Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation
 '100000' and thus no binary gaps.
Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].

"""TASK-3
An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one
index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place. For example, the rotation
of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index and 6 is moved to the
first place).
The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.
Write a function:
def solution(A, K)
that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.
For example, given
    A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
    K = 3
the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:
    [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
    [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
    [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
For another example, given
    A = [0, 0, 0]
    K = 1
the function should return [0, 0, 0]
Given
    A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    K = 4
the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]
Assume that:
N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].
